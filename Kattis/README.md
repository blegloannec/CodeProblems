# Kattis

Trivial problems are not included in this repository.

**Disclaimer:** Even though most Kattis problems are from ACM-ICPC contests (whose solution slides, testcases and even solution codes are generally published), to discourage the lamest cheaters & the laziest fakers, problems verifying at least one of the following conditions are not published in this repository:
 * score/difficulty ≥ 8.0
 * acc. users < 30
 * acc. users < 100 and score/difficulty ≥ 6.0
