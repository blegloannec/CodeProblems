# Kattis

The script [`kattis_in_dl.py`](kattis_in_dl.py) can be used to automatically download the sample inputs (and outputs) of a problem.

Trivial problems are not included in this repository.

Even though most Kattis problems are from ACM-ICPC contests (whose solution slides, testcases and even solution codes are generally published), to discourage the laziest fakers, the _hardest_ problems (very high score or very low number of accepted users) are not published either in this repository.
