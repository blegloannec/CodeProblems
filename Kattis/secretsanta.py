# !n = number of permutations on n elements without fixed points (derangements)
# If p is such a permutation such that p(n) = i < n (n-1 possible i),
# then consider j such that p(j) = n:
#  - If i = j, then removing i and n leaves us with an arbitrary
#    derangement over n-2 elements;
#  - Otherwise i â‰  j, then removing n and "rebranching" p(i) = j leaves us
#    with an arbitrary (j is chosen freely) derangement over n-1 elements.
# Hence !n = (n-1) (!(n-2) + !(n-1))
