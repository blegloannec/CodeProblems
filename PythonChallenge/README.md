# Python Challenge

[Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)

Fun and addictive programming riddles.

Levels can always be conveniently solved using Python standard library + Imaging library. Using Python is however only strictly required for level 5 (that relies on the `pickle` serialization module).

It was by the way the main source of inspiration for that shell/bash practical session [treasure hunt](https://github.com/blgatelierl2/ChasseAuTresor) (in French) of mine.
