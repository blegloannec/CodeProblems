# Data structures

These are mostly light, flexible and problem-solving-oriented implementations, made to be easily modified / enhanced / adapted and not necessarily used as black boxes (for these reasons we generally avoid using templates, nested classes, _etc_).

See also [wiki](../../../wiki/Data-structures).
