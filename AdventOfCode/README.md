# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

A nice initiative, with sometimes fun and interesting problems (not all of them though).

Competing there is however rather uninteresting as input sizes are relatively small so that (at least for *serious* problems) a naive approach usually works and is faster to code than an optimal approach to enter leaderboards...
