# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

A nice initiative, some fun and interesting problems (not all of them though).

Competing there might however not be that interesting as input sizes are relatively small so that (at least for *serious* problems) a naive approach usually works and is faster to code than an optimal approach to enter leaderboards...

Ranked 87th overall in 2016 while competing (at release time) only on 11/25 days (14 & 16-25).
