**Obvious disclaimer:** Cheating spoils the fun of problem solving, etc... However, if you arrive here looking for some hints on a problem, those codes sometimes contain comments (usually in French though) to describe the approach.

I generally use Python 2.7 and the fast Python interpreter `pypy`. I occasionally use C++, OCaml, Python 3.4...

Almost all of these codes are below the *one-minute rule* (and usually by far), though they are not necessarily optimal or optimized (they are sometimes just good enough considering the input size).

For more efficient implementations of some of these codes, check out `/HackerRank/Contests/ProjectEuler+` (harder variants of the problems, with larger inputs, generally requiring an optimal approach).

**Fun additional constrains:**
 * Problem 307, *Chip Defects*, was solved on an "actual" low-cost [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) chip (80MHz CPU), using the NodeMCU (Lua-based) firmware. It ran in 0.7s and fortunately my chip did not seem to have any defects!
