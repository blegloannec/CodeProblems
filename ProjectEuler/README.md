Almost all of these codes are (by far) below the *one-minute rule*. Though, for even more efficient implementations of some of these codes, check out `/HackerRank/Contests/ProjectEuler+`.

**Fun additional constrains:**
 * Problem 307, *Chip Defects*, was solved on an "actual" low-cost [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) chip (80MHz CPU), using the NodeMCU (Lua-based) firmware. It ran in 0.7s and fortunately my chip did not seem to have any defects!
