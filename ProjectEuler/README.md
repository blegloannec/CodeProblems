# Project Euler

![PE Profile](https://projecteuler.net/profile/NiakTheWizard.png)

**Obvious disclaimer:** Cheating is pointless and spoils the fun of problem solving, etc...

**Language:** Generally Python 2/3 with the fast interpreter `pypy`. Sometimes C++. Only occasionally (for various reasons) OCaml, Prolog, Julia, Lua and some help from Sage...

Almost all of these codes are below the *one-minute rule* (usually by far), though they are not necessarily optimal or optimized (they are sometimes just good enough considering the input size).

More efficient implementations of some of these codes are in `/HackerRank/Contests/ProjectEuler+` (harder variants of the problems, with larger inputs, generally requiring an optimal approach).

**Fun additional constraints:**
 * Problem 307, *Chip Defects*, was solved on an "actual" low-cost [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) chip (80MHz CPU), using the NodeMCU (Lua-based) firmware. It ran in 0.7s and fortunately my chip did not seem to have any defects!
